# A class inherits properties and methods from another class.
# Parent class is called Base Class, Child class is called Derived class

# there have 5 types inheritence
    1. Single Inheritance: Derived class inherit directly from the base class
            Base
              ^
              |
            Derived

    2. Multiple Inheritance: Derived class inherit from multiple base classes.
            Base1  Base2 <---
             ^              |
             |              |
            Derived ---------

    3. Multilevel Inheritance: Derived class inherit from the class which 
       is also derived class that inherit from base class.
            Base
              ^
              |
            Derived1
              ^
              |
            Derived2

    4. Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple Derived classes inherit from a single base class.
        -----> Base <-----
        |                |
        |                |
        Derived1  Derived2

    5. Hybrid Inheritance: Inheritance consisting of multiple 
       inheritance types of the above specified. Example: Multiple + Hierarchical inheritance


# Are there any limitations on Inheritance?
    Yes, it makes difficult
