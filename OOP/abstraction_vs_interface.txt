# Abstraction
    1. can't make instance directly, you have inherit to derived class, then you can access in main
    2. you can make instance from derived class.
        Example: Derived object = new Derived();

# interface
    1. can make instance directly in main, can implement to derived class
    2. you can make instance through interface
        Example: Interface object = new Derived();
