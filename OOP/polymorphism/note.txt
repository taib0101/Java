# Polymorphism means many form. Same function can act in different ways for different situation.

# two types Polymorphism
# Compile-Time Polymorphism: Method overloading (binding at compile time).
# Runtime Polymorphism: Method overriding (binding at runtime).

# Overloading: Multiple implementations of the same entity 
    (methods, operators) resolved at compile time.
# Overriding: Runtime resolution of entities with the same name 
    and different implementations (often using virtual functions).
